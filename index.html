        <h4>Work in progress</h4>
        <p>Hi, I could include some irrelevant dead language here to grab your attention... But I prefer to <span style="color: red;">tell the truth</span> about my experience. I don't have extensive experience in this specific field. Please continue reading to understand what I mean.</p>
        
        <h4>Explain yourself</h4>
        <p>And now I can explain why it's in progress. This world is constantly <span style="color: red;">evolving</span>, and I'm growing alongside it. I'm always <span style="color: red;">expanding my knowledge</span> and trying to achieve all my goals by learning new things.</p>
